# USCount-Net

Official implementation of our uncertainty-driven semi-supervised learning framework for apple flower counting with phenological awareness.

Pretrained model evaluation code is available now, full implementation will be released soon.

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel semi-supervised learning approach for accurate apple flower counting in agricultural monitoring systems. The method leverages:
- **Adaptive pseudo-label filtering mechanism based on frequent forward uncertainty estimation** to significantly enhances the robustness of semi-supervised flower counting under complex field conditions.
- **Noise-sensitive adaptive gated feature fusion module** to dynamically weights multi-scale features to preserve petal texture details while enhancing flower cluster distribution semantics via a learnable spatial gating mask. This module suppresses noise from redundant features through adaptive fusion.
